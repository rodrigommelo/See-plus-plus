// The Idea
This project is a part of the hackathon session in Academia de CÃ³digo where we were supposed to create an application which should match with theme song which was given. The theme of our project was on the song called "Wake me up" by Avicii. With the interpretation of the song, we have focused on the existential crisis issues, and with that, we have decided to create a website where people looking for a new life meaning book a random trip according to a selected budget.

// Development
After the project theme was presented, our team did a brainstorm to decide how we wanted to approach the subject, what the minimum viable product would be and how to organize the presentation of our product. 
For the development of the web app, we started by creating the skeleton of the site with HTML. Then using the bootstrap we made the site responsive.  We also used JavaScript to create some of the site functionality. 

We were divided into two groups to do the task and we used the Agile Kanban to develop the project. We met each other on every two hours to give the update of our pair work with team meeting.
